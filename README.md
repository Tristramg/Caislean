# Caisleán

*Caisleán - the Irish word for "castle". Pronounced "cash-lawn". For ease of
reference, it's safe to drop the a-fada (á) and refer to the recipes as
Caislean*

This is a set of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) recipes for deployment of
secure communication systems.

Full documentation is for the moment available on the [GitHub
Wiki](https://github.com/equalitie/Caislean/wiki) but is being progressively
improved and moved into the `doc/` directory.
