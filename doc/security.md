In this document you will find all you need to know about the security of your
server, with descriptions of security-related **design choices** in Caislean and
important recommendations on **further measures** you need to take to improve
security. Please, make sure you read it all.

# Security-related design choices in Caislean

Among the configuration files provided by Caislean for its various included
pieces of software, choices were made with security as a high criterion.
This section provides more details about changes that were made to improve
security. Specifically, these are the main security outcomes we had in mind: 

- reducing risks of illegitimate access on the server running Caislean;
- securing the content of communications between the server and its users;
- having the administrator perform some important tasks by hand to ensure a
  sufficient awareness about the important files stored on the local system.

## Security of the system running Caislean

### Automatic update notifications

Using `apticron`, available packages upgrades are periodically checked, and an
e-mail notification is sent to the administrator whenever packages can be
upgraded.

Software upgrades often fix security issues, making it important to remind the
administrator to perform them. They are one of the most basic measures for
keeping a system reasonably secure.

Since upgrades are often coupled with necessary manual operations (rebooting the
system, restarting some services), the action of upgrading packages is left to
the administrator.

This is set up in the role `common`.

### Rootkit and filesystem alteration checking

Using `rkhunter` and `chkrootkit`, periodic checks are made in order to spot
illegitimate changes in the filesystem or appearance of well-known pieces of
malware.

These tools are used together because their detection mechanisms differ.
`rkhunter` checks for any suspicious changes in files on the system, regardless
of the content of the changes. For instance, an alert will be raised if a binary
under `/usr/bin` is changed outside of a system upgrade. On the other hand,
`chkrootkit` maintains a list of known malware file hashes and behavior and
raises an alert in case of a match.

Alerts are sent by e-mail to the administrator. This is set up in the role
`common`.

### SSH access hardening

The SSH server configuration is changed so that:

- no password-based authentication is permitted, to remove the risk of
  bruteforce attacks;
- `root` login is forbidden, so that a compromised SSH key does not lead to
  the `root` account being directly compromised;
- only one login is allowed: the one with which Ansible connects to the system,
  to make sure other logins cannot be used to access the system.

This is set up by the role `common`.

### Firewall

Using `ufw` and `iptables`, most of the traffic to and from the server is
blocked. TCP and UDP ports are by default blocked inbound and outbound, except
for 22 and 25 inbound as well as 80 and 443 outbound, as HTTP access is required
for system upgrades.

These measures may notably prevent illegitimate software from generating
network traffic, in case they are remotely controlled.

This is set up by the role `common`, and more ports are allowed in roles setting
up network services, such as OpenVPN.

### PHP hardening

Caislean includes several web-based services that require PHP: Roundcube,
Wordpress, Owncloud and others. The web server is Nginx and PHP pages are
processed by PHP-FPM.

As PHP applications are a common concern for security, part of the answer lies
in mitigating potential illegitimate access to PHP functions in advance. For
this, each PHP-based application in Caislean is associated with a unique PHP-FPM
pool running with its own UNIX user and a separate session directory. In
addition, each has a white list of directories it is allowed to access to, in
order to reduce illegitimate access to files. These measures are set by each
role associated to a particular service, such as `roundcube`, `owncloud`, etc.

To reduce the risks related to insecure PHP applications, the most potentially
dangerous PHP functions are forbidden by the PHP configuration. This is set by
the role `php-fpm`.

### Other system hardening

The role `common` also brings the following improvements:

- installation of the _backports_ repository for latest software updates;
- default file creation mask of _077_ (no access authorized to anyone not owning
  the file) through PAM's `umask` module;
- hardening of several `sysctl` parameters;
- removal of several unwanted packages, including `exim4`, `rpcbind` and
  `nfs-common`.

## Security of communications between the server and its users

### TLS cipher list

Helping securing exchanges between the server and its users is done through a
careful selection of available TLS ciphers. The cipher list first privileges
elliptic curve Diffie-Hellmann (ECDH) based ciphers sorted by decreasing key
size order, followed by "classical" Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphers. Ciphers
using SHA1
[HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) are
however placed at the end of the list, as the security of this algorithm is
increasingly questioned.

A 3DES cipher is appended for HTTPS, to ensure compatibility with Internet
ExplorerÂ 8, despite its questionable security. It is the only one that does not
provide [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy).

The cipher lists are provided in the configuration files for each service, in
the individual associated roles. Comprehensive explanations on server-side TLS
cipher list is provided on the [Mozilla
wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS).

## Manual administration tasks for better awareness

Some tasks were deliberately left to the system administrator, in order to make
sure they are conscious of the place where sensitive files are stored on their
local system.

These manual tasks are however all documented in the corresponding role
documentation.

### TLS private keys and certificates

The TLS setup used by Caislean includes:

- a certification authority (CA) certificate along with its private key;
- a certificate for the server, signed by this CA, along with its private key;
- a file containing Diffie-Hellmann parameters;
- optionally, other certificates signed by the CA, notably in case of VPN
  clients being allowed through the use of TLS certificates.

Among these, the private keys are particularly sensitive and must be protected
on the local machine used by the server administrator. For this reason, their
creation is left to the administrator, to make sure that their location is
clearly known and that a passphrase is provided.

The `tls` role documentation provides the necessary commands to create and
securely store theses files, and it is advised to use the `tls/` directory at
the root of the repository as an empty TLS CA tree, as it notably contains a
pre-configured `openssl.cnf` file.

The CA public certificate, the server certificate and private key, and the
Diffie-Hellmann parameters are pushed to the server by the `tls` role. These
files are subsequently needed by all TLS-enabled services (Nginx, Postfix,
Prosody, etc.).

### DKIM private key

[DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DKIM) is used to certify that an e-mail was
legitimately sent from a given domain. It relies on adding a header to every
sent e-mail, containing a cryptographic signature based on a private key. The
corresponding public key is available as a specific DNS entry for the given
domain, and is read by the receiving server to check the signature.

Similarly to the TLS keys, the administrator is asked to generate the DKIM key
pair on the local system. The documentation for the role `virtualmail` provides
OpenSSL-based commands to generate these keys.

### PGP backup private key and backup server security

Caislean offers the possibility of making encrypted incremental backups thanks
to Backupninja and Duplicity. Backupninja is the backup scheduler, the backup
itself being performed by Duplicity, which requires a PGP key pair.

The PGP private and public keys must be stored as files on the local system, and
are subsequently uploaded to the server. This upload as well as the
documentation on how to export the PGP keys to files are part of the
`backupninja` role.

This role's documentation also includes instructions on setting up the backup
server's SSH access to allow the backups to be pushed to it.

# Awareness and mindful behavior the administrator needs to have

Caislean helps set up in few simple steps one or more secure servers. This means
that, as explained above, the cookbook includes a whole range of best practices
for basic security. Nevertheless, depending on your and your users' threat
model, it is worth pointing out that Caislean's basic settings are **just one
part** of the setup that is needed for attaining a suitable security level for
yourself and your users.

## Additional manual steps for security

By default, the servers you install with Caislean keep logs of connections,
including IP addresses that can trace back your users to their real identity.
There is still no way to avoid that globally, but you can mitigate the problem
by configuring a short log retention (via `logrotate` rules) and redacting IP
addresses that are processed by `syslog` by using appropriate filters.

Depending on your user base, you may or may not be able to have a trusted
channel of communication with your users in order to give them your TLS
certificate. Remember that if you cannot hand over your certificate in a trusted
way, verification may become tricky for less expert users. This means that users
may tend to install the certificate in their clients without verifying it.

Since at the moment you can only use self-signed certificates, we recommend you
to either make sure that all your users can get the certificate through a
trusted channel or, if this is impossible for logistical reasons, to sign the
certificate with GnuPG and provide them with the fingerprint and instructions
for verification.

## Communication and awareness

Besides technical tweakings on your part, there are some more recommendations to
improve the security of your server.

We strongly recommend you to **inform your users** on how to improve their
security through end-to-end encryption (for example advising them to read
manuals on
[GPG](https://learn.equalit.ie/wiki/To_send_an_email_that_no_one_but_me_and_the_recipient_can_read)
and
[OTR](https://learn.equalit.ie/wiki/I_want_to_know_about_options_for_private_chat)),
as well as to warn them about the limits of personal VPNs (you can find a good
explanation [here](https://help.riseup.net/it/vpn), in the section "Limitations
to using RiseupVPN").

You should also understand that having implemented basic security settings in
the server you run does not protect you from every possible risk. Depending on
the **political context** where you and your community live and where your
activities take place, as well as where your server is located, your server
might be seized or intercepted by authorities and there might be legal
proceedings against you, your organization and/or your users.

Before you set up your server and start offering services to your community, it
is therefore strongly advisable to **consider the risks** that you may be facing
and to make decisions accordingly as regards the location of your servers, the
services you want to offer (which may be for instance illegal in some states),
the activities you want to take place on your server and also your legal status
(in some countries you could be labeled as a provider and further rules could
apply to your case).

Finally consider that a strong user community, if well informed, may be one of
your main strengths in many critical situations.
